# Walmart Sales Forecasting using Machine Learning

**📌 Project Overview**
This project focuses on analyzing Walmart sales trends and building a predictive model to forecast future sales. The dataset contains key economic indicators such as fuel price, unemployment rate, and consumer price index (CPI), which influence sales performance.

**Key Objectives:**
* Analyze historical sales trends across stores.
* Identify the impact of holidays and economic factors on sales.
* Build a forecasting model for future sales predictions.

**🛠 Technologies Used**
* Python (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-Learn) – Data processing & modeling.
* Matplotlib / Seaborn – Data visualization.
* Time-Series Models (ARIMA, Prophet) – Forecasting sales trends.
* Jupyter Notebook – Model development and experimentation.

**📂 Dataset Details**
The dataset (Walmart DataSet.csv) contains 6,435 rows and 8 columns, covering sales data from multiple Walmart stores.

**Column Name	Description**
* Store	Store number.
* Date	Week of sales.
* Weekly_Sales	Sales for the given store in that week.
* Holiday_Flag	1 if it’s a holiday week, else 0.
* Temperature	Temperature on the sale day.
* Fuel_Price	Cost of fuel in the region.
* CPI	Consumer Price Index.
* Unemployment	Unemployment rate in the region.

**🚀 Implementation Steps**

1️⃣ Data Preprocessing

* Load and clean Walmart sales data.
* Handle missing values and date formatting.
  
2️⃣ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

* Identify seasonal trends in sales.
* Analyze holiday effects on revenue.
* Correlation analysis with fuel prices, CPI, and unemployment rates.

3️⃣ Sales Forecasting Models

* Linear Regression, ARIMA, Prophet, XGBoost, and LSTMs for sales prediction.
* Evaluate model performance using RMSE and MAPE.

4️⃣ Visualization & Insights

* Sales trends over time.
* Holiday vs. non-holiday sales comparison.

** 📜 Key Takeaways**
✅ Time-series forecasting for accurate sales predictions.

✅ Data-driven insights on holiday impact and external factors.

✅ Machine learning models for trend analysis.
